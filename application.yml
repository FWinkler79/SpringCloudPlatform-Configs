# Eureka Client Configurations:
# 
# Should generally be managed in each client application / service separately.
# This is because the config-server itself should be found via the 
# service registry. Therefore, configurations can only be fetched
# once a client has connected to Eureka and looked up the config-server.
# Hence, every client needs to know where to find Eureka BEFORE it 
# can get any configurations from the config-server.
